            "This project is the online representation of me -- what I want the world to know about me and some of the stuff I do. It's not the best website in the world, but it's my website, and honestly I'm quite happy with how it's turning out.",
            "This is not my first attempt at making a personal website; in fact, it's not my first personal website at all. However, the old website was a bit of a mess, and you probably wouldn't want to see it. This one was created with a bit more experience and better understanding of web technologies and human-computer interaction. Some parts of it served as a personal challenge, such as making the code both readable and expandable so that I may add more to the website over the months to come.",
            "Alongside expandability, accessibility of the website is of big concern to me. I expect that much of my work on the site in the upcoming months will revolve around that. (As someone with a visual impairment, I have at least partly experienced how bad design choices make navigating a website even worse for someone who doesn't have perfect eyesight.)"

            "During college, I had discovered a personal love for TTRPGs, especially when it comes to GMing them. One of my favorite games quickly became Night's Black Agents, in large part thanks to the way the game handles combat in a fast-paced manner and investigation in a more intuitive way than most other systems.",
            "However, I quickly found that the game has less character creation tools than a more popular game such as D&D. The tools it does have are functional enough, including a calculating PDF, but they're far from perfect. In fact, several of my players had struggled getting the calculating PDF to work.",
            "This inspired me to make a calculating character sheet that is web-based and hopefully easier to use.",
            "This project heavily relies upon the Vue framework, which was my choice for helping facilitate the many dozen interactive components that I will need to build into the site in order to make it a functional character sheet. (The Night's Black Agents game uses the GUMSHOE system, which has a large variety of skills and stats that must be tracked.)",
            "The project is not in any state to be released yet, even as an alpha version, but a link to it will be added here once the repository is publicly available."
