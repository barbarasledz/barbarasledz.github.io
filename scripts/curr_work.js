It's not the best website in the world, but it's my website, and honestly I'm quite happy with how it's turning out. That said, it's an on going project because I don't expect to be done with it for a long time; there's always more ways to improve!",

            "During college, I had discovered a personal love for TTRPGs. One of my favorite games quickly became Night's Black Agents.",
            "However, the game has less character creation tools than a more popular game such as D&D. The tools it does have are functional but not always the most intuitive.",
            "This inspired me to make a calculating character sheet that is web-based and hopefully easier to use.",
