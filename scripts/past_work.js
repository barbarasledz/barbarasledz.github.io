However, needfinding interviews done by my team discovered that these popular streaming apps fail in one genre that does not align to the common title-album-artist model: classical music.",
            "Through agile development and weekly sprints, we tested over a dozen prototypes (ranging from low-fi paper mockups to higher-fidelity wireframes) in the span of a few weeks until we discovered a search system that was intuitive, simple, and efficient for users. At the end of the process, we did a final defense of our design and process before our classmates and professors."

            "\"MMORPGs: The Tech and the Compromises\" is an article series that looks at some of the design decisions and compromises that must be made when creating an MMORPG game. It explains why MMORPGs all seem to have similar inherent flaws, why those flaws exist, and what alterative design solutions exist. The examples in the articles feature many popular games, from the often-studied game \"World of Warcraft\" to the technologically-interesting systems of \"Elder Scrolls Online\".",
            "The series was written with MMORPG players of any level in mind. This target audience is likely familiar with some of the common player jargon, such as \"patch day\" or \"maintenance\" or \"instance\". However, they may not be familiar with more technical terms and acronyms like \"TCP\" and \"UDP\" and what the difference is between the two."
