            "For a total of 8 of my 12 undergraduate quarters of classes at Northwestern University, I worked as a peer mentor for the Computer Science department in the McCormick School of Engineering. Through this program, I was tasked with aiding instructors in teaching their courses.",
            "Most of my responsibilities involved direct contact with the students who were taking these classes, from leading tutorials and lab sessions to hosting office hours to help students with their projects and studies. During the COVID-19 pandemic, especially when classes were online, these tasks became even more vital in helping ensure that students were not at risk of falling behind.",
            "Other responsibilities included grading, providing feedback on course changes across quarters, and (in later quarters) helping train newer peer mentors."

            "Spotify and its music streaming rivals have a search and organization system that works well for most types of popular music. However, a process of needfinding interviews done by my team discovered that these popular streaming apps fail in one genre that does not align to the common title-album-artist model: classical music.",
            "In response, the team began work on an app tailored for meeting the needs of listeners of classical music. Through agile development and weekly sprints, we tested over a dozen prototypes (ranging from low-fi paper mockups to higher-fidelity wireframes) in the span of a few weeks until we discovered a search system that was intuitive, simple, and efficient for users. At the end of the process, we did a final defense of our design and process before our classmates and professors."

            "\"MMORPGs: The Tech and the Compromises\" is an article series that looks at some of the design decisions and compromises that must be made when creating a game with lots of content and lots of simultaneous players. It explains why MMORPGs all seem to have similar inherent flaws, why those flaws exist, and what alterative design solutions exist. The examples in the articles feature many popular games, from the often-studied game \"World of Warcraft\" to the technologically-interesting systems of \"Elder Scrolls Online\".",
            "It is meant for players of MMORPGs of any level. This target audience is likely familiar with some of the common player jargon, such as \"patch day\" or \"maintenance\" or \"instance\". However, they may not be familiar with more technical terms and acronyms like \"TCP\" and \"UDP\" and what the difference is between the two."
