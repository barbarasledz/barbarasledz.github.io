# Personal Website: Barbara Sledz

This github repository contains the frontend content of my personal website. The 'main' branch will always the most up-to-date live version of the website; other branches may exist for WIP content. 

The main purpose of this website is to provide publicly-available information about myself, my past work, and my current work in greater detail than a simple resume would allow. Showcasing some prior experience and skills in the field are an additional bonus.

The live deployment of the website is available at: [https://barbarasledz.github.io/](https://barbarasledz.github.io/)

## Technologies Used
This website is made primarily using HTML/CSS/JS, alongside with the Vue framework. Additional technologies may be added as the website is expanded upon to meet new needs. 


## Schedule and Changelog
- 16 June 2022 -- Creation of repository, start of design planning using low-fidelity mockups on paper. Small skeleton of an initial layout created. Added placeholder content and began setup of multiple pages.
- 17 June 2022 -- Work on past projects page, initial styling of info cards. Added functionality to dynamically fill in values for the cards using Vue 2.6; may update this in the future to use Vue 3 instead (Vue 2.6 is what I'm more familiar with, but Vue 3 is probably better).
